## Task
Dataset: World Bank Data

This dataset contains the data used for the 2006 TED Talk "The Best Stats You-ve ever seen" by Hans Rosling.

It contains 3 datasets related to country population, fertility rate and life expectancy up to 2016

## Aim:
Make a prediction Model for predicting these 3 variables

## Data Processing Notes
- Students should use preceding years for making predictions
- Students can use other data from the World Bank for making better models
- Students can add geographical information (e.g. Country Area, Climate type, Continent, OECD member, EU Member, etc...)
- Students should not waste a lot of time searching for the "best model". Select beforehand 2-3 basic Machine Learning architectures and use them, making some simple parameter searching

## Objectives
Model should be TESTED for 10 countries (selected randomly)

Make predictions for 2017
OPTIONAL: Make predictions for 2018
Compare the above results with actual historical data from the World Bank Site (e.g. for life expectancy)
